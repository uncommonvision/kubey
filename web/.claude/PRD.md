# Product Requirements Document: Kubey

## Product Overview

Kubey is a modern web dashboard for visualizing, monitoring, and managing multiple Kubernetes clusters across different environments. Built with React and TypeScript, it provides DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and development teams with a unified view of their Kubernetes infrastructure, enabling efficient cluster management and troubleshooting.

- Integration with monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana)

## User Stories

### Cluster Management
- As a DevOps engineer, I want to see all my clusters at a glance so I can quickly identify which ones need attention
- As a platform engineer, I want to monitor resource utilization across all environments so I can plan capacity effectively
- As a Kubernetes administrator, I want to compare cluster configurations so I can ensure consistency across environments

### Monitoring and Troubleshooting
- As a developer, I want to see the status of my application's pods across all environments so I can debug deployment issues
